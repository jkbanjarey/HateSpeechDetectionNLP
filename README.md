# Hate Speech Detection using NLP

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Hate Speech Detection Model** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The model is trained to classify text as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral speech. This is useful for social media moderation, online safety, and automated content filtering.

## ✨ Features
- 📝 **Detects hate speech, offensive language, and neutral speech.**
- 🤖 **Uses NLP techniques and machine learning for classification.**
- 📊 **Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.**
- 🔍 **Preprocesses text data with tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.**

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled text samples categorized into:
- **Hate Speech** 🚫
- **Offensive Language** ⚠️
- **Neutral Speech** ✅

Each text sample is:
- **Cleaned** by removing special characters and stopwords.
- **Tokenized** for better model understanding.
- **Vectorized** using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.

## 🛠 Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk tensorflow
```

## 🏗 Model Architecture
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
- **Deep Learning Models:** LSTMs, CNNs, or Transformers (e.g., BERT).
- **Loss Function:** Cross-Entropy Loss.
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer for better performance.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Process
1. 📥 **Load & preprocess the dataset.**
2. 🔄 **Tokenize and vectorize text data.**
3. 🏗 **Train different models and evaluate their performance.**
4. 🎯 **Fine-tune hyperparameters for best accuracy.**
5. 📊 **Assess results using confusion matrix & classification report.**

## 🚀 Usage
To run the model, execute the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook HateSpeechDetection.ipynb
```

## 📈 Results
The model achieves **high accuracy** in detecting hate speech. Performance is measured using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🌍 **Improve multilingual support** for better global applicability.
- 🏗 **Experiment with Transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.).**
- 🚀 **Deploy as a web API for real-time text classification.**
